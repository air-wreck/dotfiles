# dotfiles `~/.*`
This repository stores some useful config files. It is not necessarily intended to be exhaustive. There are (mostly) two kinds of files in this repository:

* Actual dotfiles (`.*`, mostly): settings for some programs I use
* Setup files (`setup.sh`): convenient setup script for some things I like to have, designed specifically for Debian Linux. I may have to expand at some point, because apparently CMU AFS is running RedHat.
