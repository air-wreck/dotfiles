# dotfiles `~/.*`
This repository stores some useful config files. It is not necessarily intended to be exhaustive. There are (mostly) two kinds of files in this repository:

* Actual dotfiles (`.*`, mostly): settings for some programs I use
* Setup files (`setup.sh`, `manual-list`): convenient setup script for some things I like to have, designed specifically for Debian Linux. I may have to expand at some point, because apparently `unix.andrew.cmu.edu` is running RedHat.

Here's an example of what it looks like:
